#  Movie Recommendation System

##  Group 5 â€“ DSA 1080 Project

This project was developed as part of the **DSA 1080** coursework by **Group 2**.

###  Team Members
- Cindy Mamang
- Lokomar samuel
- Precious Katkun
- Owen Nyameino


##  Overview

This Movie Recommendation System suggests movies based on **genre similarity**, using **content-based filtering** powered by **cosine similarity**.

The system was built using:
- Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn)
- Streamlit (for web deployment)
- GitHub (for version control and collaboration)

The model and application pipeline include:
- Data cleaning & feature engineering
- Genre-based encoding
- Similarity computation
- Recommender logic
- Model evaluation
- Streamlit web interface

---

##  Project Objective

> "Build a working machine learning pipeline that can recommend similar movies using real-world data and deploy it as an interactive web app."

### Core Steps:
-  Data preprocessing & visualization
-  Feature engineering & binning
- Model training (Random Forest)
-  Movie similarity using cosine similarity
-  Model evaluation (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score)
-  Deployment using Streamlit Cloud

ðŸ–¥ How to Run the App Locally
Clone this repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/Cindy-mamang/Movie-Recommendation-System.git
cd Movie-Recommendation-System
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Streamlit app:

bash
Copy code
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
The app will launch in your default web browser at http://localhost:8501.

 Model Evaluation
Metric	Value (Example)
Accuracy	0.78
Precision	0.80
Recall	0.79
F1 Score	0.78
MSE	1.12
RÂ² Score	0.83

These scores were obtained using a Random Forest model on binned rating data (vote_average_binned).
